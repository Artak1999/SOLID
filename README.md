# SOLID

SOLID is an acronym formed from the capital letters of the first five principles of OOP and design. The principles were coined by Robert Martin in the early 2000s, and the abbreviation was later coined by Michael Feathers. Here is what is included in the SOLID principles:
1) S - Single Responsibility Principle.
2) O - Open Closed Principle (Principle of openness / closeness).
3) L - Liskov's Substitution Principle (Barbara Liskov's Substitution Principle).
4) I - Interface Segregation Principle
5) D - Dependency Inversion Principle

# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each object has one responsibility.
# Open Closed Principle
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
# Liskov Substitution Principle
It should be possible to substitute any of its subtypes (heir class) instead of the base (parent) type (class), while the program's operation should not change.
# Interface Segregation Principle
This principle means that you should not force a client (class) to implement an interface that is not related to it.
# Dependency Inversion Principle
Top-level modules should not depend on lower-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
